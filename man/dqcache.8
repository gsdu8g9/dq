.TH dqcache 8
.SH NAME
dqcache \- DNS cache with DNSCurve support
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B dqcache
is recursive DNS server derived from 
.B dnscache
(https://cr.yp.to/djbdns/dnscache.html)
.SH CONFIGURATION
.B dqcache
runs chrooted in the directory specified by the $ROOT environment variable, under the uid and gid specified by the $UID and $GID environment variables.
.sp
.B dqcache
listens for incoming UDP packets and TCP connections addressed to port 53 of $IP. Typically 127.0.0.1.
.RS 4
.B WARNING - dqcache currently accepts packets only from localhost (127.0.0.0/8 or ::1/128).
.RE
.sp
.B dqcache
sends outgoing IPv4 packets from high ports of $IPSEND4. Typically $IPSEND4 is 0.0.0.0, meaning the machine's primary IPv4 address.
.sp
.B dqcache
sends outgoing IPv6 packets from high ports of $IPSEND6. Typically $IPSEND6 is ::, meaning the machine's primary IPv6 address.
.sp
.B dqcache
reads a list of root servers as an anchor, one record per line, from servers/@.
The record has format {IP} or {IP}|{DNSCURVEPUBLICKEY} e.g.:
.RS 4
.nf
servers/@:
198.41.0.4
2001:503:ba3e::2:30
192.228.79.201
2001:500:84::b
etc.
.fi
.RE
.sp
.B dqcache
also scans the servers directory for anchors for other domains, one record per line.
The record has format {IP} or {IP}|{DNSCURVEPUBLICKEY} e.g.:
.RS 4

.B dqcache
supports forward-only mode. If $FORWARDONLY is set, dqcache treats servers/@ as a list of IP addresses for other caches, not root servers. It forwards queries to those caches the same way that a client does, rather than contacting a chain of servers according to NS records.
.sp
.B dqcache
uses a fixed-size cache, as controlled by the $CACHESIZE environment variable. Typically $CACHESIZE is 10000000 (10MB).
.sp
.B dqcache
typically generates new DNSCurve secret-key and appropriate public-key at start of program. If environment variable $SECRETKEY is set, then dqcache loads this secret-key and computes appropriate public-key. Secret-key must be safely generated using
.BR dqcache-makekey (1).
